          Hello! My name is Andrew, and I am an Undergraduate Researcher at
          the University of South Carolina in Computer Science. Additionally,
          I treasure a fresh cup of coffee and a properly-worn math textbook.
        </div>
        <div class="bio long">
          Hello! My name is Andrew Kenneth Smith and I am an Undergraduate
          Researcher at the University of South Carolina Honors College.
          I will graduate in May of 2021 with a degree in Computer Science and
          a degree in Mathematics. I plan to pursue a PhD in Computer Science 
          beginning in the Fall of 2021. <br>
          I am deeply interested in Mathematics because it is naturally beautiful.
          A wise man invested in the stars once wrote that "Mathematics is the language
          in which God has written the universe." Consider group and ring theory,
          which are wholly about symmetries, an entirely natural phenomenon, which were
          able to prove the unsolvability of quintics. <br>
          Now, computer science is the use of the atoms of reason with computers to solve.
          The atoms of reason are known as bits. Now, bits make bytes and bytes make.. more
          bytes, and, as it seems to us today, we might be able to solve any problem imaginable
          with computation. We can encode the human genome in a 1.5 gigabyte text file.
          We have calculated pi up to 31 trillion digits. We can even talk to one another
          face-to-face from any point on the globe. Thus, we find that mathematics and 
          computer science are deeply related.<br>
          I think there is not a higher moment on earth than enjoying something that
          we have created. A campfire on a cold night is much better enjoyed after
          having split the wood by hand. A cup of coffee is much warmer to the taste
          after having brewed the nectar oneself. Caring for a child is infinitely rewarding
          when they are your own. Additionally, exploring the frontier of intelligence
          and thought is unimaginably captivating when you have constructed them. This joy of learning
          and exploration is what I continually seek.<br>
          Along the way, I do enjoy the process of splitting the wood, brewing the coffee,
          hiking the mountain, and more. I enjoy to play the piano, but I also enjoy to listen to the piano.
          A good, convincing book is necessary for development into an interesting human being.
          I recommend checking out the <a href="./books.html">books</a> I have read.
