          It seems like they all want me to fail
          But I'm not going back
          Not going back, baby
          Please tell me you don't want me to fail
          'Cause I'm not going back
          Not going back
          I could've been a tragedy
          That's why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
          'Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart
          Ain't you read the fuckin' book Things Fall Apart?
          I was never gonna stay the same
          All I ever really wanted was to change the game
          Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
          Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
          Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
          Callin' me the new Will Smith, that's Jaden
          Callin' me a faggot when I'm rapping, that's hating
          I need to slow down, what the fuck is y'all saying?
          Step inside the party, y'all niggas is mood killers
          My lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis
          I'm the boss, Michael Scott, y'all bitches is just Phyllis
          Set the world on fire, y'all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
          That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back
          Don't you know that I'm a rapist? Ask a track
          Whiskey-sippin', wanna drink the whole bottle
          But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
          Fuckin' hate me, that's what I'm used to
          Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
          Goddamn, man, there's gotta be a better way
          Than pill-poppin' all these drugs so I can stay awake
          Like I'm Jessie in this bitch, I'm so excited
          There's a party at the top, you ain't invited
          But it's lame, and all the bitches is fake
          You think about your old girl and how breaking up's a mistake
          Black dudes assume I'm closeted or kinda gay
          White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
          IAmDonald is a full-time job
          These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off
          It seems like they all want me to fail
          But I'm not going back
          Not going back, baby
          Please tell me you don't want me to fail
          'Cause I'm not going back
          Not going back
          Dirty girls love my dick, they're cockroaches
          Jewish girls eat my meat, it's not kosher
          Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
          Got nothin' against the sistas, I just don't think they're into me
          I am not a thug, AKA: what they pretend to be
          I am just myself, AKA: my worst enemy
          Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fuckin' knife
          I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
          It's cool, though, it's all good
          You want a dude who keep it real, and stay hood
          I'm sorry, babe, but I act me
          I don't act Black, whatever that be
          I'm just happy these girls seem into me now
          Yeah, they lookin' for some In N Out, animal style
          With this lettuce, cheese, bread, makin' sandwiches
          That's why you niggas fail like all of your parents' marriages
          Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
          When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
          She said to write her somethin' nice on the next track
          But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
          Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
          Believe me, it was bad, we're better off, you're welcome
          I worked hard on that song like day and night
          That whole song, made this one verse crazy, right?
          I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that
          Like that bullshit you talked before Culdesac
          I didn't know he had it in him
          Couldn't see me as Spider-Man, but now I'm spittin' venom
          Now you payin' attention, pick your fuckin' face up
          When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up
          Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
          I refuse to go back to not likin' who I was, because
          Fake love, these fake dreams
          These fake sounds
          All the things that we felt
          Your voice was screaming too loud
          I know what you're ready to be
          But it isn't with me
          So I'm ready to leave you alone
          I don't really wanna fight like this
          I don't ever wanna lose your kiss
          All I ever wanted was someone to hold on to
          I just wanna be your girl
          Everything you haven't heard
          Plus, I just wanna be with you
          (With you) With you
          (With you) With you
          (With you) I just wanna be with you
          (With you) With you
          (With you) With you
